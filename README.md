<h1>Bannertool GUI ver2.0.0 Made by Daniel</h1>

<b>What's Bannertool GUI?</b>
<br>• Bannertool GUI is a program that uses bannertool.exe, Made by [Steveice10](https://github.com/Steveice10), to automatically generate files such as banner.bin, info.smdh and icon.bin.

<b>IMPORTANT</b>
<br>• Please Download the lastest bannertool.exe version from Steveice10's [repository](https://github.com/Steveice10/bannertool/releases) and place it inside the "program" folder, which is inside the Bannertool GUI folder. If you don't do this, Bannertool GUI won't work.

<b>Features:</b>
<br>• Clear Mode: clears the files in the folder result for you. 
<br>• Bannertool Mode: uses bannertool.exe (Made by Steveice10) for generate banner.bin, info.smdh and icon.bin and allows you to input the info for icon.bin, like CIA's Name and more without having to edit/write code.

<b>Instructions:</b>
<br>• In the assets folder, you can find a banner.png and icon.png template. you can use those to know the correct sizes of images and makes your own (which should have this same names and should be on the folder assets) 
<br>• If you want to use a sound the file must be .wav and must be called "audio.wav" and must follow these requirements: 
<br> -3 seconds or less 
<br> -16 Bits 
<br> -32000 HZ 
<br> -Stereo 
<br> -PCM signed 16-bit little-endian 
<br>• If you have a 3D model (.cgfx) to use as a banner rename it to "banner.cgfx" and place it in the assets folder. 
<br>• After you have everything ready, open the correct version of Bannertool GUI (32 bit or 64 bit) and select Bannertool Mode and follow the instructions on screen.

<b>Notes: </b>
<br>• I'd appreciate if you use [this page](http://usuaris.tinet.cat/mark/smdh_creator/) to verify that the file,
 info.smdh, was generated correctly and that you'd tell me. To make sure that Bannertool GUI works as intended. 
<br>• Bannertool GUI Will only work on Windows, as it's a batch program.
