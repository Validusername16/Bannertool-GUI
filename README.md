<h1>Bannertool GUI ver2.0.0 Made by Daniel</h1>

<b>What's Bannertool GUI?</b>
<br>• Bannertool GUI is a program that uses bannertool.exe, Made by [Steveice10](https://github.com/Steveice10), to automatically generate files such as banner.bin, info.smdh and icon.bin.

<b>IMPORTANT</b>
<br>• You must download the lastest bannertool.exe version from Steveice10's [repository](https://github.com/Steveice10/bannertool/releases) and place it inside the "program" folder, which is in the Bannertool GUI folder. If you don't do this, Bannertool GUI won't work.

<b>Features:</b>
<br>• Clear Mode: clears the files in the folder result for you. 
<br>• Bannertool Mode: uses bannertool.exe (Made by Steveice10) for generate banner.bin, info.smdh and icon.bin and allows you to input the info for icon.bin, like CIA's Name and more without having to edit/write code.

<b>Instructions:</b>
<br>• Inside the "assets" folder, you will find a banner.png and icon.png template. you can use those to see the correct pixel sizes of images and make your own, which should have the same names and should be in the "assets" folder. 
<br>• If you would like to use a sound, the audio file must be a .wav and must be called "audio.wav" and must follow these requirements or it won't work: 
<br> -3 seconds or less 
<br> -16 Bits 
<br> -32000 HZ 
<br> -Stereo 
<br> -PCM signed 16-bit little-endian 
<br>• If you have a 3D model (.cgfx) you would like to use as a banner rename it to "banner.cgfx" and place it inside the "assets" folder. 
<br>• After you have everything ready, open the correct version of Bannertool GUI (32 bit or 64 bit) and select Bannertool Mode and follow the instructions on screen.

<b>Notes: </b>
<br>• I'd appreciate if you use [this page](http://usuaris.tinet.cat/mark/smdh_creator/) to verify that the file, info.smdh, was generated correctly and that you'd tell me, so I may be sure that Bannertool GUI works as intended. 
<br>• Bannertool GUI Will only work on Windows, as it's a batch program.
